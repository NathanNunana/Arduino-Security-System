# Arduino Security System

New C++ Project

Arduino code: Detects objects(person) using an ultrasonic sensor that's less than 21 inches away from the sensor that would be attached to the home of an individual 
Upon detection of the object it quickly turns the servo motor 160 degree to lock the doors of the house. Upon Entry to the house there's a pir sensor that detects the person's heat signature and activates the beeper(alarm) and sends an sms using the gsm module to the owner of the house. 
There are two LEDs that show green upon no danger(BREAK IN) and shows red when there's danger.
